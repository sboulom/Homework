            <p> I am a soon to be father looking for a change in career where I can be there for my family without
                missing too many life events.
                I currently work in a fine dining restaurant as a server. I graduated college with a Hotel
                Restaurant Management Degree and it is
                time for a change.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I love to travel and try hole in the wall restaurants. I also ask locals for recommendations on where
                they would go to eat. I'm all for being a tourist and trying out popular
                places, but I also love putting myself in the locals shoes.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I am originally from Los Angeles, California. I lived in New York and San Francisco in my past. I've
                visited many states in the east coast
                and have many more states on my bucket list. I've traveled recently to Thailand, Laos, China and
                Japan. I've definitely been bit by the
                travel bug. I would love to go to South America next. You learn so much from traveling. You learn so
                much about people you travel with and
                people you meet. Theres a whole world out there, why not check it out. You only live once right?
